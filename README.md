## üí° Overview

This is a mono repository for my home infrastructure and Kubernetes cluster. I try to adhere to Environment as Code (EaC), Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and GitOps practices using tools like [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2), [Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate), and [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

## <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/refs/heads/master/logo/logo.svg" alt="üå±" width="20" height="20"> Kubernetes

My Kubernetes cluster is deployed with [Talos](https://www.talos.dev). This is a semi-hyper-converged cluster, workloads and block storage are sharing the same available resources on my nodes while I have a separate server with BTRFS for NFS/SMB shares, bulk file storage and backups.

### Core Components

- [cert-manager](https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager): Creates SSL certificates for services in my cluster.
- [cilium](https://github.com/cilium/cilium): Internal Kubernetes container networking interface.
- [cloudflared](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared): Enables Cloudflare secure access to `external` ingresses.
- [external-dns](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns): Automatically syncs ingress DNS records to Cloudflare and Unifi.
- [external-secrets](https://github.com/external-secrets/external-secrets): Managed Kubernetes secrets using [Bitwarden Secrets Manager](https://github.com/external-secrets/bitwarden-sdk-server/).
- [ingress-nginx](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx): Kubernetes ingress controller using NGINX as a reverse proxy and load balancer.
- [rook](https://github.com/rook/rook): Distributed block storage for persistent storage.
- [sops](https://github.com/getsops/sops): Managed secrets for Kubernetes and Terraform which are committed to Git. Stores the secrets required to bootstrap the cluster.
- [spegel](https://github.com/spegel-org/spegel): Stateless cluster local OCI registry mirror. No more image pull backoff.
- [volsync](https://github.com/backube/volsync): Automatic backup and recovery of persistent volume claims to NFS and Cloudflare R2. Lose nothing when the cluster blows up!

### GitOps

[Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2) watches the clusters in my [kubernetes](./kubernetes/) folder (see Directories below) and makes the changes to my clusters based on the state of my Git repository.

The way Flux works for me here is it will recursively search the `kubernetes/apps` folder until it finds the most top level `kustomization.yaml` per directory and then apply all the resources listed in it. That aforementioned `kustomization.yaml` will generally only have a namespace resource and one or many Flux kustomizations (`ks.yaml`). Under the control of those Flux kustomizations there will be a `HelmRelease` or other resources related to the application which will be applied.

[Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate) watches my **entire** repository looking for dependency updates, when they are found a PR is automatically created. When some PRs are merged Flux applies the changes to my cluster.

### Directories

This Git repository contains the following directories under [Kubernetes](./kubernetes/).

```sh
üìÅ kubernetes
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅ apps             # applications
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅ bootstrap        # bootstrap procedures
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅ flux             # flux system configuration
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅ components     # re-useable components used by apps
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅ meta
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅ repositories # sources for flux, e.g. helm charts
```

### Flux Workflow

This is a high-level look how Flux deploys my applications with dependencies. In most cases a `HelmRelease` will depend on other `HelmRelease`'s, in other cases a `Kustomization` will depend on other `Kustomization`'s, and in rare situations an app can depend on a `HelmRelease` and a `Kustomization`. The example below shows that `mongo` won't be deployed or upgrade until `mongo` and `volsync` are installed and in a healthy state.

```

### üèòÔ∏è VLANs

| Name    | ID | CIDR            |
|---------|----|-----------------|
| Default | 0  | 192.168.1.0/24  |
| servers | 20 | 192.168.20.0/24 |
| iot     | 30 | 192.168.30.0/24 |

### üåé DNS

In my cluster there are two instances of [ExternalDNS](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns) running. One for syncing private DNS records to my `UniFi Gatway Max` using [ExternalDNS webhook provider for UniFi](https://github.com/kashalls/external-dns-unifi-webhook), while another instance syncs public DNS to `Cloudflare`. This setup is managed by creating ingresses with two specific classes: `internal` for private DNS and `external` for public DNS. The `external-dns` instances then syncs the DNS records to their respective platforms accordingly.

### üè† Home DNS

My Home DNS is fairly complicated, with several forwarding steps.

```mermaid
graph TD
  A>internal-external-dns] -->|Updates|B0
  B0>Unifi Network Application] -->|Updates|B
  B>Unifi Router DNS] -->|Cluster or Hostname request|C
  C>Answers Request]
  B>Unifi Router DNS] -->|Forwards other requests|D
  D>PiHole] -->|Blocked or matches additional custom hosts|C
  D>PiHole] -->|Forwards other requests|E[DNSCrypt-Proxy]
  E>DNSCrypt-Proxy] -->|Forwards requests to DNSCrypt or DoH resolver|C
```

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Dependencies

While most of my infrastructure and workloads are self-hosted I do rely upon the cloud for certain key parts of my setup. This saves me from having to worry about three things. (1) Dealing with chicken/egg scenarios, (2) services I critically need whether my cluster is online or not and (3) The "hit by a bus factor" - what happens to critical apps (e.g. Email, Password Manager, Photos) that my family relies on when I no longer around.

Alternative solutions to the first two of these problems would be to host a Kubernetes cluster in the cloud and deploy applications like [HCVault](https://www.vaultproject.io/), [Vaultwarden](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden), [ntfy](https://ntfy.sh/), and [Gatus](https://gatus.io/); however, maintaining another cluster and monitoring another group of workloads would be more work and probably be more or equal out to the same costs as described below.
